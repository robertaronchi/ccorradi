abstract: The current Covid-19 pandemic has demanded a degree of sacrifice from individuals for the sake of the greater good. Individuals have taken costly actions, both volitional and imposed, to reduce harm to strangers. The pandemic oers a unique opportunity to examine a fundamental question. Where does the distinction between self and other lie? This question can be framed as a moral dilemma between competing motives of self-serving and pro-social behavior. Given the multifaceted uncer- tainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, we propose to assess self-other distinction using models of decision-making under risk. We administered two surveys, where participants selected between sure and risky treatments for fictitious diseases, for themselves, a loved one and a stranger. Choice of treatment option showed risk-seeking tendencies that decreased with expected disease severity, across all targets, suggesting risk preferences for the other parallel those for the self. However, distinctions across targets emerged when decisions were conditioned on treatment cost, with sure treatments cho- sen more often for self and a close other; and sure treatment assigned a higher price for diseases with low expected severity, for self and other. These findings inform on what constitutes a measure of self-other distinction; and the limits of what can be asked of an individual in service to a stranger.
