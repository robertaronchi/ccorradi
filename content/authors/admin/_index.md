I am a Cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist with long-lasting  experience in the study of the human adult brain, through behavioral measures, electrophysiology and brain imaging. I'm interested in the study of the neural mechanisms underlying pain, personal affect and their interaction with social cognition and decision-making.

I am also invested in understanding the cognitive and neural processes underlying the diagnosis and management of people’s pain. This is a research line with both fundamental and translational relevance, and organized on the following axes: neural/physiological fingerprinting of somatic affect,
prediction of real-life pain-management behaviour from brain activity, and
effect of attention on pain experience and relief.
